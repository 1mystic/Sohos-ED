# SOHOS ED

**School Optimization & Holistic Operating System**

---

## IDENTITY

**Name:** SOHOS ED (pronounced: *So-hoss*)  
**Blend:** SOHO (Soji/Holistic) + OS (Operating System/Echos)  
**Engine:** SOHOS Tech  
**Application:** SOHOS International | SOHOS Preschools | Edu-Optima Platform

**Concept:** A direct, symmetrical blend. High-end global feel with scholastic precision.  
**Living Lab:** Kanha House

---

## WHAT IS SOHOS ED?

A data-driven educational consultancy and SaaS provider designed to fix the **"Operational Gap"** in Indian Budget Private Schools.

**The Gap:** Government (NEP 2020) mandates holistic education. Schools lack the processes to implement it.

**The Fix:** SOHOS (School Operating & Holistic System) — a plug-and-play operating system that automates government compliance (PARAKH/HPC) while instilling Japanese-style discipline and student autonomy.

**We do not sell curriculum. We sell culture-as-code.**

---

## VISION & MISSION

### VISION
Redefine Indian education by shifting focus from **"Teaching" (Content)** to **"Being" (Character)**, creating a generation of self-reliant, community-focused citizens.

### MISSION
Equip 1,000 budget schools with the SOHOS framework by 2030, reducing operational costs while raising educational standards to global levels.

**Core Transformation:** Compliance burden → Operational efficiency

---

## THE PROBLEM

**Target:** 400,000+ Affordable Private Schools (APS) in India

**Pain Points:**
- NEP 2020/PARAKH-specific HPC compliance penalties
- High infrastructure costs with limited budgets
- Teacher attrition and operational inefficiency
- Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) data gaps
- Lack of holistic progress documentation
- Digital literacy barriers to conventional SaaS adoption

---

## THE SOLUTION: S.O.H.O.S. FRAMEWORK

**School Operating & Holistic System (Proprietary)**

**Core Innovation:** Culture-as-code | Proven low-tech > Expensive high-tech

### MODULE A: The "Han" Algorithm (Social Engineering)

**Function:** Automated creation of mixed-ability student groups (Hans)

**Purpose:**
- Eliminate bullying through strategic grouping
- Enforce peer-to-peer learning
- Build collaborative intelligence
- Generate social-emotional learning data

**Output:** Optimized group compositions based on academic performance, behavioral patterns, and social dynamics

---

### MODULE B: Digital "Toban" (Responsibility Tracking)

**Function:** Gamified tracking of student duties

**Applications:**
- Soji (cleaning duties)
- Lunch service rotation
- Classroom management tasks
- Community service activities

**Data Conversion:** Physical actions → Holistic Progress Card data points

**Impact:** Builds responsibility, autonomy, and provides compliance evidence

---

### MODULE C: The "Chokai" Engine (Morning Alignment)

**Function:** AI-curated daily discussion topics

**Format:** 5-minute teacher-led sessions on ethics and current affairs

**Coverage:**
- NEP value education mandates
- Critical thinking development
- Community awareness
- Leadership rotation opportunities

**Resource:** Zero infrastructure | Maximum impact

---

### SUPPLEMENTARY: Student Learning Tools

**Community-Based Digital Resources:**
- Practical hands-on learning platforms
- Tool-based skill development modules
- Interactive educational resources
- Accessible to all students within SOHOS network

**Philosophy:** Democratize access to quality learning tools beyond classroom walls

---

### Edu-Optima Platform: The Optimization Engine

Automated NEP 2020 compliance + Resource allocation system that converts school operational data into actionable transformation roadmaps.

**Technical Core:** Linear Programming for budget optimization | Compliance automation | Evidence generation

---

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

### Why SOHOS ED vs. Conventional EdTech?

**1. NEP-ALIGNED SPECIALIZATION**
- Not generic LMS or tutoring apps
- Direct PARAKH domain mapping through HPC automation
- 360° evidence collection via Han groups, Chokai, Toban systems
- Foundational-to-secondary stage coverage

**2. BUDGET-FOCUSED EFFICIENCY**
- Free audit generates instant savings roadmaps
- Example: 20% janitor cost reduction via Soji implementation
- No heavy implementation overhead
- CapEx-conscious recommendations

**3. PROVEN LOW-TECH INNOVATION**

## OPTIMIZATION LOGIC

**Algorithm:** Knapsack Problem (Resource Allocation)  
**Objective:** Maximize NEP Compliance Score (0-100)  
**Constraints:** Budget (₹) | Time (Teacher Hours) | Space (sq. ft)

### Decision Matrix Examples

| SCHOOL GOAL | CONSTRAINT | RECOMMENDATION | METHOD |
|-------------|------------|----------------|--------|
| Skills Lab Setup | Budget < ₹10k | Origami Math Lab (Paper-based geometry) | Monozukuri |
| Skills Lab Setup | Budget > ₹2L | IoT/Robotics Lab (Hardware kits) | Technology Integration |
| Improve Hygiene | Budget: Low | Implement Soji (Student Cleaning Time) | Save 20% janitorial costs |
| Holistic Report Card | Tech: None | Manual Activity Log (Paper → Digital) | Progressive digitization |
